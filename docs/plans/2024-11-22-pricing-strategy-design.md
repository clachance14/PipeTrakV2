# PipeTrak V2 Pricing Strategy
**Date:** 2024-11-22
**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** Cory LaChance

## Executive Summary

PipeTrak V2 addresses a critical pain point in industrial construction: **lack of real-time visibility into test package completion**, leading to $100K-250K in preventable overtime costs per project during end-of-project "mad rush" turnover.

**Pricing Model:** Simple tiered per-project pricing with unlimited users
**Price Range:** $199-499/month per active project
**Target Market:** Industrial piping contractors and project owners managing $500K-$10M projects
**Go-to-Market Strategy:** Land-and-expand (start with 1 project, expand to multiple projects + annual contracts)

---

## Market Context

### Target Customers
1. **Industrial piping contractors** (also general contractors) managing brownfield construction projects
2. **Project owners** (refineries, chemical plants, industrial facilities) requiring robust tracking solutions

### Current Pain Points
- **Excel spreadsheets**: Manual, error-prone, no real-time updates, version control nightmare
- **Paper/clipboard**: Physical paperwork, data entry lag, poor visibility
- **Legacy software**: Desktop-based, expensive, poor UX, limited mobile support

### Core Value Proposition

**The "Mad Rush" Problem:**
Test packages sitting at 80-90% complete for weeks with zero visibility → Everything pushed to end of project → 2-3 weeks of massive overtime:
- QC teams working 60-80 hour weeks
- Client inspectors on overtime
- Contractors, foremen, crews working weekends
- Safety personnel covering extended shifts

**Total hidden cost:** $100K-250K per project in overtime + schedule delays + rushed errors + client relationship damage

**PipeTrak Solution:**
Real-time test package visibility → Proactive completion throughout project → Eliminate overtime crunch → Save $100K-250K per project

**ROI:** 17x-33x return on investment

## Pricing Tiers

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Monthly | Annual (20% off) | Target Customer |
|------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | $199/mo | $1,910/year ($159/mo) | First-time users, pilot projects, small contractors |
| **Professional** | $349/mo | $3,349/year ($279/mo) | Active contractors running 2-3 projects ⭐ *Most Popular* |
| **Enterprise** | $499/mo | $4,790/year ($399/mo) | Large contractors, project owners, multi-project accounts |

### Competitive Positioning

- **Above** generic construction tools (Fieldwire: $39-74/project/mo) - justified by industrial specialization
- **Below** enterprise construction software (Procore: $31-46/user/mo × 20 users = $620-920/mo) - unlimited users per project
- **Value-aligned**: 0.1-0.2% of project value ($2M-$10M projects)

## Sales Messaging & Positioning

### Lead with the Pain Point

**Opening question:**
"How much overtime did you spend in the last month of your previous project?"

**Follow-up:**
"What if you could see test package completion in real-time and avoid the end-of-project crunch entirely?"

### ROI Calculator (Sales Tool)

**Inputs:**
- Project contract value
- Typical overtime hours at project close-out
- Number of team members

**Outputs:**
- Estimated overtime cost savings
- PipeTrak cost vs. savings
- ROI multiple

**Example:**
- $5M project, 1,200 overtime hours, $100/hour blended rate
- Overtime cost: $120,000
- PipeTrak Enterprise (12 months): $5,988
- **Savings: $114,012 (20x ROI)**

### Case Study Template

**Title:** "[Company Name] Eliminates $[Amount] in Overtime Costs on $[Project Value] Project"

**Structure:**
1. **Challenge:** Test packages sitting at 80-90% complete, invisible to PM until too late
2. **Solution:** PipeTrak real-time visibility, proactive package monitoring
3. **Results:**
   - 8 test packages identified at 85% completion 3 weeks early
   - Progressively sold off throughout project
   - Eliminated 2-week overtime crunch
   - Saved $120K in overtime costs
   - Client delighted with smooth handoff

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Feature Gating (Required for Launch)
Implement tier-based feature flags in codebase:

```typescript
// User subscription tier check
const userTier = currentUser.subscription.tier; // 'starter' | 'professional' | 'enterprise'

// Feature gates
const canExportPDF = ['professional', 'enterprise'].includes(userTier);
const canUseAPI = userTier === 'enterprise';
const canUploadLogos = ['professional', 'enterprise'].includes(userTier);
const maxUsers = userTier === 'starter' ? 10 : Infinity;
const dataRetentionDays = userTier === 'starter' ? 90 : Infinity;
```

### Phase 2: Subscription Management
- Stripe integration for billing
- Tier upgrade/downgrade flows
- Multi-project tracking per account
- Volume discount automation

### Phase 3: Marketing Assets
- Pricing page (comparison table)
- ROI calculator (interactive)
- Case study templates
- Sales deck with pain point messaging

## Success Metrics

### Target Customer Distribution
- Starter: 20-30% of customers (trials converting, small contractors)
- Professional: 60-70% of customers (primary revenue driver)
- Enterprise: 10-20% of customers (highest LTV, lowest churn)

### Expansion Metrics
- **Trial → Paid conversion:** >30%
- **Starter → Professional upgrade:** >50% within 3 months
- **Project expansion:** Average customer has 2.5 active projects within 12 months
- **Annual contract conversion:** >40% of monthly customers convert to annual within 6 months

### Revenue Metrics
- **Target ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** $350-450/month (blended across tiers + multi-project)
- **Target LTV:CAC ratio:** >3:1
- **Target gross churn:** <5% monthly

## Competitive Alternatives Considered

### Why NOT Per-User Pricing?
- Industrial crews are large (15-30 people)
- Per-user pricing penalizes large teams
- Creates friction ("Do we really need to add this welder to the system?")
- Per-project aligns better with how budgets are allocated

### Why NOT Usage-Based (Per Weld)?
- Hard to predict costs (creates buyer anxiety)
- Penalizes active users (opposite of what we want)
- Complex pricing page (harder to communicate value)

### Why NOT Freemium Forever?
- Industrial contractors have budgets ($500K-$10M projects)
- Free tier attracts wrong customers (hobbyists, tire-kickers)
- 14-day trial is sufficient to prove value
- Want to monetize from day one

## Next Steps

1. **Design document review:** Validate pricing strategy with stakeholders
2. **Feature gating implementation:** Add subscription tier checks to codebase
3. **Stripe integration:** Set up billing infrastructure
4. **Pricing page design:** Create comparison table and CTAs
5. **ROI calculator:** Build interactive calculator for sales conversations
