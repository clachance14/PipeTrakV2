## Still Reading?

**Here's the truth:**

Most affiliate programs pay 10-20% for 12 months. Maybe $500 total.

We pay **30-10% forever**. Potentially **$30,000+ over 10 years**.

**Why?**

Because word-of-mouth from people who actually USE the product is worth more than any ad we could run.

You're not a salesperson. You're a trusted colleague making a recommendation.

**And we want to make it worth your while.**
