# PipeTrak V2: 5-Year Growth Plan
## Solo Builder + Affiliate-Driven Sales Model

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02
**Status:** Strategic Planning
**Target:** $990K ARR by Year 5 (34 customers)

---

## Executive Summary

PipeTrak V2 is a bootstrapped, affiliate-driven SaaS platform targeting mid-size brownfield construction contractors. Built solo using AI development tools (Claude Code), the business model relies on generous affiliate commissions (30% → 15% → 10%) to drive word-of-mouth sales while maintaining ultra-lean operations.

**5-Year Vision:**
- Build a portfolio of 4 industrial construction SaaS apps
- Generate $55K/month combined revenue ($660K/year)
- Maintain 80%+ profit margins through AI-assisted development
- Replace full-time job income within 18 months
- Create passive retirement income stream

**This plan is deliberately conservative.** All projections assume:
- Slow, manual sales process (no viral growth)
- High early churn (20-25%)
- Limited market penetration (34 customers = <3% of TAM)
- Part-time development (10-15 hours/week until Month 18)

## Portfolio Strategy (Years 3-10)

### The Vision: Industrial Construction App Suite

**Philosophy:** Build interconnected tools for the same customer base (brownfield contractors). Cross-sell through existing relationships and affiliate network.

### App #2: Welder Certification Tracker (Launch Year 3)
- **Problem:** Certification expiration tracking, compliance audits
- **Pricing:** $199-$399/project/month
- **Target:** Same customers using PipeTrak
- **Revenue Goal:** $15K MRR by Year 5

### App #3: Equipment Inspection Logger (Launch Year 4)
- **Problem:** Safety inspection compliance, photo documentation
- **Pricing:** $149-$299/project/month
- **Target:** Cross-sell to existing customers
- **Revenue Goal:** $12K MRR by Year 6

### App #4: Material Requisition System (Launch Year 5)
- **Problem:** Ordering, delivery tracking, inventory management
- **Pricing:** $249-$499/project/month
- **Target:** Upsell to larger customers
- **Revenue Goal:** $10K MRR by Year 7

### Bundle Pricing Strategy

**Individual Apps:**
- PipeTrak: $399/month
- Welder Tracker: $299/month
- Equipment Logger: $249/month
- **Total if purchased separately:** $947/month

**Bundle:** $699/month (26% discount)

**Economics:**
- Customer saves $248/month
- You get higher LTV (harder to churn from bundle)
- Affiliates earn 30% of bundle ($210/month)

## Path to $20K/Month (Quit Full-Time Job)

### The Goal: Replace Salary in 12-18 Months

**Target:** $20K/month net income

**Required Revenue:**

- Month 7-12: 1 customer/month (6 total)
- Month 13-18: 0.75 customers/month (4 total)
- **Total by Month 18:** 13 customers

**This is achievable with affiliates.**

### Monthly Breakdown to $20K MRR

| Month | Customers | Projects | Revenue | Affiliate Payout (30%) | Net to You |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|------------------------|------------|

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Critical Risks

**RISK: Market too small**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (limits growth ceiling)
- **Mitigation:** Expand to adjacent markets (facilities management, new construction) in Year 4

**RISK: Competitor emerges**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (price pressure, churn)
- **Mitigation:** Network effects (industry templates), switching costs (data lock-in), integration moat

**RISK: Economic downturn hits construction**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (budget cuts, churn)
- **Mitigation:** Brownfield work is maintenance (counter-cyclical to new construction)

**RISK: Can't quit job in 18 months**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (burnout, slower growth)
- **Mitigation:** Extend timeline to 24 months, reduce burn rate, consider part-time job

**RISK: Affiliate model doesn't work**
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High (no distribution)
- **Mitigation:** Pivot to traditional sales in Year 2, adjust commission structure

**RISK: Key customer churn**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (revenue volatility)
- **Mitigation:** Diversify customer base (no customer >10% of revenue), build sticky features

**ARR:** $1.08M
**Customers:** 34
**Margins:** 20-25%
**Growth:** 30-40% YoY

**Valuation Range:** $3.2M - $6.5M

- Most Likely (4-5x ARR): $4.3M - $5.4M
- Optimistic (6x ARR): $6.5M

**After taxes (30%):** $3M - $4.5M net

### Potential Acquirers

**Strategic Buyers:**
- Procore, Autodesk, Oracle (construction software)
- Large EPC firms (Bechtel, Fluor, Jacobs)

**Financial Buyers:**
- Private equity (Accel-KKR, Vista Equity)
- SaaS rollups

### Alternative: Don't Sell

**Year 5 Cash Flow:**
- Revenue: $1.08M
- Profit: $230K/year
- Your salary: $200K
- **Distributions:** $30K/year (increasing over time)

**Years 6-10:**
- Revenue grows to $3M (with App #2, #3, #4)
- Profit: $900K-$1M/year
- **This is better than selling**

---

## Conclusion: The Solo Builder Path

This plan is **deliberately conservative** and assumes:
- No lucky breaks
- Slow, manual sales
- You stay mostly solo (AI-assisted)
- High margins over high growth

**Even in this "pessimistic" scenario:**
- You quit your job in 18 months
- You build a $1M ARR business in 5 years
- You earn $200K+/year by Year 5
- You have a $3-6M asset (if you want to sell)
- Or you keep it and earn $300K-$1M/year forever

**The unsexy truth:** This is a grind. It's not a VC-backed rocket ship.

**But it's real.** It's achievable. And with AI tools like Claude Code, you can actually build this solo.

**Next 30 days:** Launch alpha, recruit first affiliates, validate the model.

**Let's build.**
