## Program Overview

The PipeTrak Affiliate Program rewards industry professionals who refer qualified customers to PipeTrak. We offer the most generous commission structure in construction software because we believe word-of-mouth from trusted sources is worth more than any advertising.

**Our Philosophy:** We'd rather pay you 30% than spend $5,000 on ads that don't work.

### Commissions

**Q: What if the customer cancels?**
A: Commissions stop when they cancel. If they return later, commissions resume.

**Q: What about downgrades?**
A: Commission decreases if they reduce projects. But you still earn on what remains.
