# Specification Quality Checklist: User Profile Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT users need (view profile, edit name, upload photo, change password) without specifying HOW to implement
- ✅ No mention of React, TypeScript, TanStack Query, or other implementation technologies in requirements
- ✅ Written in user-centric language that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- ✅ All 58 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (2 clicks, 500ms load time, 95% success rate, etc.)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "users see results within 2 seconds" not "API response time < 200ms")
- ✅ 4 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios (26 total scenarios)
- ✅ 10 edge cases documented with expected behavior
- ✅ Clear scope boundaries defined in "Out of Scope" section (14 items)
- ✅ Dependencies (8 items) and Assumptions (10 items) explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ All functional requirements map to acceptance criteria in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios progress logically from P1 (view profile) → P1 (edit name) → P2 (upload photo) → P2 (change password)
- ✅ Each user story can be tested independently and delivers standalone value
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and verifiable without implementation knowledge

## Notes

Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). No clarifications needed - all requirements are concrete based on:
1. Industry-standard authentication patterns (Supabase Auth)
2. Common profile management UX conventions
3. Existing project patterns from Features 015-016 (mobile responsiveness, accessibility)
4. Single-org architecture established in Feature 004

Assumed defaults (documented in Assumptions section):
- Password minimum 8 characters (Supabase default)
- Avatar max 2MB (industry standard for profile photos)
- 256x256px avatar optimization (balance of quality/performance)
- Public read access for avatars (appropriate for team collaboration)
- Modal-based UI (selected during brainstorming, no navigation needed)
