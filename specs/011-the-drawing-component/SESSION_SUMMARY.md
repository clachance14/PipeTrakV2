## 🎯 Session Accomplishments

### ✅ Phase 3.3: Contract Tests (T010-T012)
Created 3 comprehensive contract test suites with 85 total tests:

1. **drawing-selection.contract.test.ts** (20 tests)
   - Toggle, selectAll, clearSelection functions
   - URL persistence and validation
   - 50-drawing limit enforcement
   - Edge cases (rapid toggles, URL format)

2. **inheritance-detection.contract.test.ts** (28 tests)
   - isInherited function (5 scenarios)
   - getBadgeType function (all variants)
   - getTooltipText function
   - Integration with ComponentRow
   - Edge cases (false positives, empty strings)

3. **component-override.contract.test.ts** (37 tests)
   - showInheritanceWarning logic
   - currentValues detection
   - clearAllAssignments mutation
   - Re-inheritance behavior
   - Dialog UI behavior
   - Edge cases (orphaned components, partial failures)

**Status**: All tests failing as expected (TDD approach) ✓

### ✅ Phase 3.4: Core Implementation (T024, T028)

1. **T024: useClearComponentAssignments Mutation**
   - Added to `src/hooks/useComponentAssignment.ts`
   - Clears area_id, system_id, test_package_id to NULL
   - Updates updated_at timestamp
   - Invalidates components and drawings queries
   - Returns updated component or throws error

2. **T028: ComponentAssignDialog Enhancements**
   - Added inheritance detection logic
   - Shows inheritance warning (yellow alert with icon)
   - Displays "(inherited from drawing)" notation in dropdowns
   - Added "Clear all assignments" checkbox
   - Button text changes: "Update Component" vs "Clear All"
   - Supports both bulk mode (existing) and single component mode (new)
   - Disabled dropdowns when "Clear all" is checked

### ✅ Phase 3.5: Page Integration (T034-T037)

1. **T034: Selection Mode Toggle**
   - Added "Select Mode" button with CheckSquare/Square icons
   - Toggles between outline and default variant
   - Clears selections when exiting selection mode

2. **T035: useDrawingSelection Integration**
   - Integrated selection hook with URL state management
   - Passes selectedDrawingIds to DrawingTable
   - Manages visibleDrawingIds for selectAll

3. **T036: DrawingBulkActions Toolbar**
   - Conditionally rendered when selections exist
   - Shows "X drawings selected"
   - "Assign Metadata" and "Clear Selection" buttons

4. **T037: Dialog State Management**
   - Added assignDialogOpen state
   - Fetches areas, systems, testPackages for dialog
   - Passes props to DrawingAssignDialog
   - Opens on "Assign Metadata" click

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Bug Fixes

1. **Created alert.tsx Component**
   - Missing shadcn/ui Alert component
   - Supports default and destructive variants
   - Includes Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription exports

2. **Fixed Type Errors**
   - DrawingRow uses `area?.id` not `area_id`
   - DrawingBulkActions uses `onAssignMetadata` not `onAssign`
   - DrawingAssignDialog requires areas, systems, testPackages arrays
   - DrawingTable selection props updated

3. **Updated DrawingTable Interface**
   - Added optional selection props (selectionMode, selectedDrawingIds, onToggleSelection, onSelectAll)
   - Passes props through to DrawingRow and DrawingTableHeader

## 📝 Next Steps (Critical Path)

### 1. Integration Tests (T013-T020) - Priority: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

Write 8 scenario-based tests from `quickstart.md`:
- T013: Scenario 1 - Inline edit single drawing
- T014: Scenario 2 - Bulk assign multiple drawings
- T015: Scenario 3 - "No change" option
- T016: Scenario 4 - Component inherits from drawing
- T017: Scenario 5 - Override component assignment
- T018: Scenario 6 - Clear component assignments
- T019: Scenario 8 - Optimistic update rollback
- T020: Scenario 9 - URL state persistence

**Files to Create**:
```
tests/integration/drawing-assignment.test.tsx
tests/integration/drawing-bulk-operations.test.tsx
tests/integration/drawing-selection.test.tsx
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 8 scenarios pass
- Coverage ≥70% overall
- No flaky tests

### 2. Unit Tests (T038-T043) - Priority: MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

Test utilities, hooks, and components in isolation:
- T038: `metadata-inheritance.test.ts`
- T039: `useAssignDrawings.test.ts`
- T040: `useDrawingSelection.test.ts`
- T041: `DrawingAssignDialog.test.tsx`
- T042: `DrawingBulkActions.test.tsx`
- T043: Badge components tests

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ≥80% coverage for `src/lib/**`
- ≥80% coverage for `src/hooks/**`
- ≥60% coverage for `src/components/**`

### 3. Performance & Documentation (T044-T048) - Priority: LOW
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

- T044: Performance test (bulk 50 drawings <10s)
- T045: Edge case (51st drawing blocked)
- T046: Edge case (URL too long fallback)
- T047: Manual testing (10 quickstart scenarios)
- T048: Update CLAUDE.md

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Single assignment: <1s (target ~200ms)
- Bulk 50 drawings: <10s (target ~2-3s)
- Optimistic update: <50ms perceived latency
- All manual scenarios validated

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Acceptable Limitations (Per Spec)
1. **False Positive Badges**: Component manually assigned to same value as drawing shows "inherited" (no way to distinguish without audit log)
2. **No Auto Re-inheritance**: Clearing component doesn't auto-inherit until next drawing assignment (intentional)
3. **50 Drawing Limit**: Hard limit for bulk operations (prevents performance issues)

### Pre-existing Issues (Not Feature 011)
- Some TypeScript errors in other files (usePackageReadiness, useWelderUsage, etc.)
- These existed before this feature and don't block Feature 011

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Invalid UUID format in URL (filtered out)
- ✅ URL too long (50 UUIDs = 1849 chars, safe under 2048)
- ✅ Drawing not in current project (checkbox hidden)
- ✅ Drawing filtered out (checkbox checked but not visible)
- ✅ User refreshes page (selection persists via URL)

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### RLS Enforcement
- ✅ All mutations check `can_manage_team` permission
- ✅ Drawing queries filter by project membership
- ✅ Component queries filter by project membership
- ✅ Audit logging on milestone updates

### Input Validation
- ✅ Drawing IDs validated as UUIDs
- ✅ Component IDs validated as UUIDs
- ✅ Metadata values validated against lookup tables
- ✅ 50-drawing limit enforced client and server-side

---

## 📚 Documentation

### Updated Documentation
- ✅ tasks.md (33 tasks marked complete)
- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (comprehensive status report)
- ✅ SESSION_SUMMARY.md (this file)
- ⏳ CLAUDE.md (update pending T048)

### Code Documentation
- ✅ JSDoc comments on complex functions
- ✅ Inline comments explaining non-obvious logic
- ✅ Type definitions with documentation
- ✅ Contract specs with usage examples

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Technical Decisions
1. **URL State for Selections**: Enables sharing, persists across refresh
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Improves perceived performance
3. **Inheritance Detection**: Client-side comparison, no extra DB columns
4. **Component Mode**: Single dialog for bulk and single-component use cases

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Missing Alert Component**: Created following shadcn/ui patterns
2. **Type Mismatches**: DrawingRow structure uses nested objects
3. **Prop Interface Alignment**: Ensured all components use consistent naming
4. **State Management**: Coordinated selection, expansion, and filter state

### Best Practices Applied
- ✅ TDD workflow (tests written before implementation)
- ✅ Type-first development (interfaces defined upfront)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ Composition over inheritance
- ✅ Immutable state updates
