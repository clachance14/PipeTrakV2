# Tasks: Drawing & Component Metadata Assignment UI

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/clachance14/projects/PipeTrak_V2/specs/011-the-drawing-component/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
**Feature Branch**: `011-the-drawing-component`

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ DONE: Loaded TypeScript 5 + React 18 + Supabase + Radix UI stack
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: 5 entities extracted (DrawingAssignmentPayload, BulkDrawingAssignmentPayload, InheritanceSummary, SelectionState, InheritanceIndicator)
   → ✅ contracts/: 4 contract files found (drawing-assignment, drawing-selection, inheritance-detection, component-override)
   → ✅ research.md: 6 technical decisions extracted
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Database migration for RPC functions
   → Tests: 4 contract tests + 8 integration tests (from quickstart.md)
   → Core: 3 hooks + 1 utility library + types
   → UI: 3 new components + 5 modified components
   → Integration: Page integration + URL state
   → Polish: Unit tests, performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T048)
6. Dependencies enforced: Database → Types → Utilities → Hooks → Components → Page → Tests
7. Parallel execution: 18 tasks marked [P] (contract tests, types, independent components)
8. Validation: ✅ All 4 contracts have tests, all 5 entities have types, all 8 scenarios have integration tests
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- TDD approach: Tests before implementation

## Phase 3.1: Database Setup
- [X] T001 Create migration `supabase/migrations/00024_drawing_assignment_function.sql` with `assign_drawing_with_inheritance` RPC function (single drawing assignment with inheritance logic)
- [X] T002 Add `assign_drawings_bulk` RPC function to same migration (bulk assignment with 'NO_CHANGE' handling)
- [X] T003 Run migration and verify functions exist via `npx supabase db diff`
- [X] T003a Create migration `supabase/migrations/00025_add_metadata_descriptions.sql` to add description columns
  - Add `description VARCHAR(100)` to `areas` table
  - Add `description VARCHAR(100)` to `systems` table
  - Add `description VARCHAR(100)` to `test_packages` table
  - Apply with `npx supabase db push --linked`
- [X] T003b Regenerate TypeScript types after description columns added
  - Run: `npx supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/types/database.types.ts`
  - Verify Area, System, TestPackage types include description field

## Phase 3.2: Type Definitions
**All these tasks can run in parallel (different type definitions in same file)**
- [X] T004 [P] Add `DrawingAssignmentPayload` interface to `src/types/drawing-table.types.ts`
- [X] T005 [P] Add `BulkDrawingAssignmentPayload` and `MetadataValue` type to `src/types/drawing-table.types.ts`
- [X] T006 [P] Add `InheritanceSummary` interface to `src/types/drawing-table.types.ts`
- [X] T007 [P] Add `SelectionState` and `SelectionActions` interfaces to `src/types/drawing-table.types.ts`
- [X] T008 [P] Add `BadgeType` and `InheritanceIndicator` types to `src/types/drawing-table.types.ts`
- [X] T008a [P] Add `UpdateDescriptionPayload` interface to `src/types/drawing-table.types.ts`
  - Fields: entity_type ('area' | 'system' | 'test_package'), entity_id (string), description (string | null)

## Phase 3.3: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.4
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

### Contract Tests (All Parallel)
- [X] T009 [P] Contract test for drawing assignment in `tests/contract/drawing-assignment.contract.test.ts` (test single + bulk assignment, inheritance summary, error handling)

- [X] T011 [P] Contract test for inheritance detection in `tests/contract/inheritance-detection.contract.test.ts` (test isInherited, getBadgeType, getTooltipText with 5 scenarios)
- [X] T012 [P] Contract test for component override in `tests/contract/component-override.contract.test.ts` (test showInheritanceWarning, currentValues, clearAllAssignments)
- [X] T012a [P] Contract test for metadata descriptions in `tests/contract/metadata-description.contract.test.ts`
  - Test PATCH /api/metadata/area/:id/description updates area description
  - Test PATCH /api/metadata/system/:id/description updates system description
  - Test PATCH /api/metadata/test_package/:id/description updates test package description
  - Test enforces 100 char limit, allows NULL to clear, validates permissions
  - All tests MUST FAIL initially (no hooks implemented yet)

- [ ] T020a Write integration test for Scenario 10 (Edit metadata description) in `tests/integration/metadata-description.test.tsx`
  - Test: Open assignment dialog, click area dropdown, see name + description
  - Test: Hover over area option, see pencil icon (permission-gated)
  - Test: Click pencil icon, popover opens with current description
  - Test: Edit description, save, see updated description in dropdown
  - Test: Character counter shows "X/100 characters"
  - Test: Description truncates at 50 chars with "..." in dropdown
  - Test: Description syncs to other dialogs/pages (FR-049 to FR-058)

## Phase 3.4: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### Utilities

- [ ] T040 [P] Unit tests for `src/hooks/useDrawingSelection.ts` in `src/hooks/useDrawingSelection.test.ts` (test URL parsing, 50-drawing limit enforcement)

### Component Tests
- [ ] T041 [P] Component test for `src/components/drawing-table/DrawingAssignDialog.tsx` in colocated `.test.tsx` file (test single mode, bulk mode, "No change" option)
- [ ] T042 [P] Component test for `src/components/drawing-table/DrawingBulkActions.tsx` in colocated `.test.tsx` file (test toolbar visibility, button states)
- [ ] T043 [P] Component test for InheritanceBadge and AssignedBadge in colocated `.test.tsx` files (test tooltip text, styling)
- [ ] T043a [P] Component test for `src/components/MetadataDescriptionEditor.tsx` in colocated `.test.tsx` file
  - Test: Renders with current description pre-filled
  - Test: Character counter updates as user types
  - Test: Save button disabled when description exceeds 100 chars
  - Test: Saves on button click, calls mutation hook
  - Test: Cancels on ESC key or Cancel button
  - Test: Closes popover after successful save

### Performance & Edge Cases
- [ ] T044 Performance test: Create 50 test drawings, verify bulk assignment completes in <10s (target ~2-3s) - documented in `tests/performance/bulk-assignment.perf.test.ts`
- [ ] T045 Edge case test: Test selection limit enforcement (51st drawing blocked) in `tests/integration/drawing-selection.test.tsx`
- [ ] T046 Edge case test: Test URL too long fallback (though should be impossible with 50 limit) in `tests/integration/drawing-selection.test.tsx`

### Documentation & Manual Testing
- [X] T047 Run all quickstart test scenarios from `quickstart.md` (includes metadata description editing scenario) and document results - User manually tested assignment workflow ✅
- [X] T048 Update `CLAUDE.md` with Feature 011 context (drawing assignment patterns, inheritance behavior, badge logic, URL state management, metadata description editing) - Comprehensive documentation added ✅

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Contract Tests (After Types Complete)
```bash
# Launch T009-T012 together (4 parallel tasks):
Task: "Write contract test for drawing assignment in tests/contract/drawing-assignment.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Write contract test for drawing selection in tests/contract/drawing-selection.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Write contract test for inheritance detection in tests/contract/inheritance-detection.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Write contract test for component override in tests/contract/component-override.contract.test.ts"
```

### Example 2: Type Definitions (After Database Migration)
```bash
# Launch T004-T008 together (5 parallel tasks):
Task: "Add DrawingAssignmentPayload interface to src/types/drawing-table.types.ts"
Task: "Add BulkDrawingAssignmentPayload and MetadataValue type to src/types/drawing-table.types.ts"
Task: "Add InheritanceSummary interface to src/types/drawing-table.types.ts"
Task: "Add SelectionState and SelectionActions interfaces to src/types/drawing-table.types.ts"
Task: "Add BadgeType and InheritanceIndicator types to src/types/drawing-table.types.ts"
```

### Example 3: Badge Components (After Utilities Complete)
```bash
# Launch T025-T026 together (2 parallel tasks):
Task: "Create src/components/drawing-table/InheritanceBadge.tsx component"
Task: "Create src/components/drawing-table/AssignedBadge.tsx component"
```

### Example 4: Unit Tests (After Implementations Complete)
```bash
# Launch T038-T040 together (3 parallel tasks):
Task: "Unit tests for src/lib/metadata-inheritance.ts in src/lib/metadata-inheritance.test.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for src/hooks/useAssignDrawings.ts in src/hooks/useAssignDrawings.test.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for src/hooks/useDrawingSelection.ts in src/hooks/useDrawingSelection.test.ts"
```

## Notes

### TDD Discipline
- **Contract tests (T009-T012) MUST fail** before implementing hooks/utilities (T021-T024)
- **Integration tests (T013-T020) MUST fail** before implementing UI components (T025-T033)
- Verify red → green → refactor cycle for each task
- Commit tests + implementation together after each task passes

### File Modifications
**IMPORTANT**: These tasks modify the same file sequentially (NOT parallel):
- T029 and T030 both modify `DrawingRow.tsx` → T030 depends on T029
- T034, T035, T036, T037 all modify `DrawingComponentTablePage.tsx` → run in order

### Parallel Opportunities
18 tasks marked [P] can run simultaneously:
- Types (T004-T008): 5 parallel
- Contract tests (T009-T012): 4 parallel
- Badge components (T025-T026): 2 parallel
- Unit tests (T038-T043): 6 parallel
- Performance tests (T044): 1 (can run with T045-T046)

### Coverage Targets
- Overall: ≥70%
- `src/lib/metadata-inheritance.ts`: ≥80% (utility library)
- `src/hooks/*.ts`: ≥80% (business logic)
- `src/components/**`: ≥60% (UI components)

### Performance Targets
- Single drawing assignment: <1s (target ~200ms per data-model.md)
- Bulk 50 drawings: <10s (target ~2-3s per research.md)
- Optimistic update latency: <50ms perceived

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts** (4 files):
   - drawing-assignment.contract.ts → T009 (contract test) + T022 (useAssignDrawings hook)
   - drawing-selection.contract.ts → T010 (contract test) + T023 (useDrawingSelection hook)
   - inheritance-detection.contract.ts → T011 (contract test) + T021 (metadata-inheritance.ts)
   - component-override.contract.ts → T012 (contract test) + T024 (useClearComponentAssignments) + T028 (modify ComponentAssignDialog)

2. **From Data Model** (5 entities):
   - DrawingAssignmentPayload → T004 (type definition)
   - BulkDrawingAssignmentPayload → T005 (type definition)
   - InheritanceSummary → T006 (type definition)
   - SelectionState → T007 (type definition)
   - InheritanceIndicator → T008 (type definition)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios** (10 scenarios):
   - Scenario 1 → T013 (integration test)
   - Scenario 2 → T014 (integration test)
   - Scenario 3 → T015 (integration test)
   - Scenario 4 → T016 (integration test)
   - Scenario 5 → T017 (integration test)
   - Scenario 6 → T018 (integration test)
   - Scenario 7 → T044 (performance test)
   - Scenario 8 → T019 (integration test)
   - Scenario 9 → T020 (integration test)
   - Scenario 10 → T045 (edge case test)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Database (T001-T003) → Types (T004-T008) → Tests (T009-T020) → Utilities (T021) → Hooks (T022-T024) → Components (T025-T033) → Page (T034-T037) → Polish (T038-T048)
