# Tasks: Mobile Milestone Updates

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/clachance14/projects/PipeTrak_V2/specs/015-mobile-milestone-updates/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Tests written first (TDD), implementation follows.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, FOUND)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a **single project** (React SPA frontend):
- Source: `src/` at repository root
- Tests: `tests/` at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Test mocking infrastructure required by all contract tests

- [X] T001 [P] Setup localStorage mock in tests/setup/localStorage.mock.ts (exported for all test files)

**Checkpoint**: Test mocks ready - contract tests can now be written

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core utilities that ALL user stories depend on - MUST be complete before any user story can begin

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete - foremen can efficiently search and filter on mobile despite small screens

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Work Offline with Automatic Sync (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable foremen to update milestones offline with automatic queue sync when connection returns

**Independent Test**: Enable offline mode (DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Offline), update 3 milestones ‚Üí verify "3 updates pending" badge, go online ‚Üí verify auto-sync starts, verify badge shows green checkmark, verify badge disappears after sync

### Tests for User Story 3 (Write FIRST, ensure they FAIL)

- [ ] T028 [US3] Integration test for offline sync journey in tests/integration/offline-sync.test.tsx (User Story 3 acceptance scenarios 1-5: queue offline updates, show pending badge, auto-sync on reconnect, show success indicator, handle sync failures with retry)

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T031 [US3] Add sync orchestration to DrawingComponentTablePage in src/pages/DrawingComponentTablePage.tsx (call useSyncQueue hook, trigger sync on 'online' event, handle sync result with toast notifications)
- [ ] T032 [US3] Wrap useUpdateMilestone hook with offline queueing in src/hooks/useUpdateMilestone.ts (check useNetworkStatus, if offline ‚Üí enqueue to localStorage instead of mutation, if online ‚Üí execute mutation directly)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete - foremen can work offline with automatic sync, resilient to connectivity issues

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - View Progress on Mobile (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable foremen to view component and drawing-level progress on mobile for situational awareness

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 US1 ‚Üí P1 US2 ‚Üí P2 US3 ‚Üí P2 US4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (integrates with US1 in DrawingComponentTablePage)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (wraps useUpdateMilestone) but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 components but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
2. Contract tests before integration tests
3. Foundation utilities before user story work
4. Core components before page integration
5. Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup (Phase 1)** - All 4 tasks can run in parallel:
```bash
Task: "Setup localStorage mock in tests/setup/localStorage.mock.ts"
Task: "Setup navigator.onLine mock in tests/setup/networkStatus.mock.ts"
Task: "Setup window.innerWidth mock in tests/setup/viewport.mock.ts"
Task: "Setup crypto.randomUUID mock in tests/setup/crypto.mock.ts"
```

**Foundational Tests (Phase 2)** - All 3 contract test files can run in parallel:
```bash
Task: "Contract tests C001-C015 in tests/contract/offline-queue.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Contract tests C036-C060 in tests/contract/sync-behavior.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Contract tests C016-C035 in tests/contract/responsive-ui.contract.test.ts"
```

**Foundational Implementation (Phase 2)** - After tests written, implementations can run in parallel:
```bash
Task: "Implement offline queue operations in src/lib/offline-queue.ts"
Task: "Implement sync manager in src/lib/sync-manager.ts"
Task: "Implement responsive utilities in src/lib/responsive-utils.ts"
```

Then hooks (all depend on lib/* but can run in parallel):
```bash
Task: "Create useOfflineQueue hook in src/hooks/useOfflineQueue.ts"
Task: "Create useNetworkStatus hook in src/hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts"
Task: "Create useSyncQueue hook in src/hooks/useSyncQueue.ts"
Task: "Create useMobileDetection hook in src/hooks/useMobileDetection.ts"
```

**User Story 2 Component Adaptations** - T022-T024 can run in parallel (different files):
```bash
Task: "Adapt DrawingSearchInput for mobile in src/components/drawing-table/DrawingSearchInput.tsx"
Task: "Adapt StatusFilterDropdown for mobile in src/components/drawing-table/StatusFilterDropdown.tsx"
Task: "Adapt CollapseAllButton for mobile in src/components/drawing-table/CollapseAllButton.tsx"
```

**Polish (Phase 7)** - T037-T041 can run in parallel (different concerns):
```bash
Task: "Add double-tap zoom prevention in src/index.css"
Task: "Add accessibility labels and roles in all mobile components"
Task: "Verify touch target sizes across all components"
Task: "Add performance monitoring in DrawingComponentTablePage"
Task: "Add error boundary for mobile components"
```

**Once Foundation complete, ALL user stories can start in parallel** (if team capacity allows):
```bash
# Team member 1:
Task: "Phase 3: User Story 1 - Update Milestones from Mobile Device"

# Team member 2:
Task: "Phase 4: User Story 2 - Navigate and Search on Mobile"

# Team member 3:
Task: "Phase 5: User Story 3 - Work Offline with Automatic Sync"

# Team member 4:
Task: "Phase 6: User Story 4 - View Progress on Mobile"
```

- **src/lib/\*\***: ‚â•80% (utilities & business logic)
- **src/components/\*\***: ‚â•60% (UI components)
- **src/hooks/\*\***: ‚â•70% (custom hooks)

### TDD Workflow

1. Write test (Red phase)
2. Run test ‚Üí verify it fails
3. Implement minimal code (Green phase)
4. Run test ‚Üí verify it passes
5. Refactor while keeping tests green
6. Commit tests + implementation together

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Tests first**: Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD mandatory per Constitution III)
- **Commit strategy**: Per-task or logical groups, include test + implementation together
- **Checkpoints**: Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Mobile testing**: Use Chrome DevTools device toolbar (375px for mobile, 768px for tablet, 1440px for desktop)
- **Offline testing**: Use DevTools Network tab ‚Üí check "Offline" to test queue behavior
- **localStorage inspection**: DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí pipetrak:offline-queue

---

**Total Tasks**: 45 (T001-T045)
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 days (based on 60 contract tests + 4 integration suites + responsive UI adaptation)
**MVP Tasks**: T001-T027 (Setup + Foundation + US1 + US2 = 27 tasks)
**Constitution Compliance**: ‚úÖ TDD workflow, TypeScript strict mode, no database changes, reuses existing hooks
