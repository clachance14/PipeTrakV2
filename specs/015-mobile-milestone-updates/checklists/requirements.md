# Specification Quality Checklist: Mobile Milestone Updates

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
✅ **Passed**: The spec focuses on user needs (foremen updating milestones in the field), describes behavior from user perspective, and avoids implementation details like React, Zustand, TanStack Query, etc. All language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **Passed**:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 31 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-002: "minimum 44x44px touch targets" is measurable)
- Success criteria are measurable (SC-001: "under 10 seconds", SC-004: "under 3 seconds", SC-006: "under 50ms")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (SC-007: "modern mobile browsers" instead of "iOS Safari 14+, Chrome 90+")
- All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
- 7 edge cases identified with clear resolution strategies
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- Dependencies and Assumptions sections both present

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **Passed**:
- All functional requirements traceable to user scenarios (e.g., FR-001-007 support User Story 1, FR-013-021 support User Story 3)
- User scenarios cover all primary flows: basic updates (P1), navigation (P1), offline sync (P2), progress viewing (P2)
- Success criteria align with feature goals (SC-001 validates P1 milestone updates, SC-002 validates P2 offline sync)
- Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout (viewport sizes, browser storage, not specific frameworks)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic. No clarifications needed. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks`.
