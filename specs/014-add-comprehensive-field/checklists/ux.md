# UX Requirements Quality Checklist: Field Weld QC Module

**Purpose**: Pre-implementation validation of UI/UX requirements completeness, clarity, and consistency. This checklist evaluates the quality of user interface requirements documentation, NOT implementation correctness.

**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Domain**: User Experience (UI Components, Forms, Dialogs, Tables, Responsive Design, Accessibility)
**Depth**: Standard (Pre-implementation review for UI component development)

## Usage Notes

**What This Checklist Tests**:
- ✅ Are UI requirements clearly documented?
- ✅ Are visual specifications complete and measurable?
- ✅ Are interaction patterns consistent across components?
- ✅ Are accessibility requirements defined?
- ✅ Are responsive design requirements specified?

**What This Checklist Does NOT Test**:
- ❌ Does the UI render correctly? (implementation testing)
- ❌ Do buttons respond to clicks? (QA verification)
- ❌ Are colors visually appealing? (design review)

**Pre-Implementation Gate**:
Use this checklist before beginning UI component implementation (Tasks T032-T048, T049-T051, T067-T075). Resolve [Gap] items in critical categories (Dialogs, Forms, Accessibility, Responsive) before coding.

**High-Priority Gaps**:
Items marked [Gap] in these categories should be documented before implementation:
- Accessibility (CHK031, CHK033, CHK037)
- Responsive Design (CHK026, CHK027, CHK028)
- Error States (CHK054, CHK057)
- Loading States (CHK061)
- Confirmation Flow (CHK079)
