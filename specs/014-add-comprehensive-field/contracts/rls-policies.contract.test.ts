/**
 * Contract Tests: RLS Policies for Field Weld QC Module
 *
 * Tests multi-tenant isolation and role-based access control for field_welds and welders tables.
 *
 * References:
 * - FR-041: All team members can view field welds and welders
 * - FR-042: Restrict field weld creation/import to foremen, QC inspectors, and admins
 * - FR-043: Restrict welder assignment to foremen and project managers
 * - FR-044: Restrict NDE result recording to QC inspectors only
 * - FR-045: Restrict welder management to users with can_manage_team permission
