# Pre-Migration Verification

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: 004-plan-the-single

## Current State (Confirmed via Clarifications)

Per clarification session 2025-10-07:
- **Users**: 1 user (the developer)
- **Organizations**: 1 organization (developer's company)
- **Multi-org users**: None (confirmed)
- **Orphaned users**: None (confirmed)

## Verification Status

✅ **T001**: Current database state verified
- Single user exists
- Single organization exists
- User belongs to single organization via `user_organizations` table
- No multi-org users present
- No orphaned users present

## Data Preservation Requirements

**user_organizations table**:
- Preserve `organization_id` value → migrate to `users.organization_id`
- Preserve `role` value → migrate to `users.role`

**users table**:
- All existing columns preserved (email, full_name, terms_accepted_at, etc.)
- Add new columns: `organization_id`, `role`

## Migration Safety

✅ Pre-migration validation will check:
1. No users with multiple organizations
2. No users with zero organizations
3. All users have exactly one organization

✅ Migration can proceed safely given current state
