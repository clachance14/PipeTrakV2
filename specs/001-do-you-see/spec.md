## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: Who is responsible for creating and providing the Supabase staging project credentials? ‚Üí A: Project lead creates Supabase project and shares URL/key in team .env template (with CLI access for migrations and database commands)
- Q: What is the policy when test coverage thresholds aren't met on a critical hotfix? ‚Üí A: Temporary bypass allowed with follow-up ticket - merge permitted, tests required in next PR
- Q: For the initial Sprint 0 database schema with RLS policies - should multi-tenant organization isolation be fully implemented or simplified for pilot? ‚Üí A: Multi-tenant schema with basic RLS - tables support multi-org but minimal policy enforcement
- Q: What CI failure recovery behavior should developers expect when the pipeline fails? ‚Üí A: Fail fast with logs - immediate failure notification with direct link to error logs
- Q: How should initial test data be seeded in the staging database for development and testing? ‚Üí A: No seed data Sprint 0 - defer to Sprint 1, use empty database for now

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **developer on the PipeTrak V2 team**, I need a **production-ready development infrastructure** so that I can **confidently develop features with automated quality gates, deploy to staging environments, and ensure code quality through enforced test coverage**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has made code changes, **When** they push to a feature branch, **Then** the CI pipeline automatically runs linting, type checking, tests with coverage reporting, and build verification

2. **Given** the CI pipeline is running, **When** test coverage falls below the defined thresholds (70% utils, 60% components, 80% business logic), **Then** the pipeline fails and prevents the PR from being merged

3. **Given** a developer needs to work with the database, **When** they run the Supabase CLI locally, **Then** they can apply migrations, generate TypeScript types, and test against a local database that mirrors staging

4. **Given** a developer wants to test authentication, **When** they run the test suite, **Then** tests for AuthContext and ProtectedRoute pass with mocked Supabase client and achieve ‚â•80% coverage

5. **Given** the initial database schema is created, **When** developers generate TypeScript types from the schema, **Then** type-safe database queries are available throughout the codebase with strict typing

6. **Given** all CI checks pass on main branch, **When** code is merged, **Then** Vercel automatically deploys to staging with the updated Supabase configuration

7. **Given** the CI pipeline encounters a failure, **When** the check fails, **Then** the developer receives immediate notification with direct links to error logs without auto-retry

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Supabase connection fails during tests? (Should use mocked client, not real connection)
- What happens when a developer doesn't have `.env` configured? (Clear error message with setup instructions)
- What happens when coverage thresholds aren't met on a critical hotfix? (Temporary bypass allowed with documented follow-up ticket to add tests in next PR)
- What happens when migration files conflict between developers? (Not applicable - solo developer environment)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- **FR-001**: System MUST run automated checks (lint, type-check, test, build) on every pull request and push to main branch
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce test coverage thresholds: ‚â•80% for utilities (src/lib/), ‚â•60% for components (src/components/), ‚â•70% overall
- **FR-003**: System MUST fail the CI pipeline when any quality gate fails (lint errors, type errors, test failures, coverage below threshold, build failures)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow temporary coverage threshold bypass for critical hotfixes with documented follow-up ticket to add tests in subsequent PR
- **FR-005**: System MUST report test coverage results visibly in the CI pipeline output

**Supabase Environment**
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a staging Supabase environment with uuid-ossp and pg_trgm extensions enabled
- **FR-007**: System MUST support Supabase CLI connection to shared staging environment for running migrations, executing scripts, and generating types
- **FR-008**: System MUST include initial database schema with organizations, users, projects, user_organizations tables structured for multi-tenant support with basic Row Level Security (RLS) policies for org-level data isolation (minimal enforcement for Sprint 0, full policies deferred to Sprint 1)
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate TypeScript types from Supabase schema that are committed to version control (src/types/database.types.ts)
- **FR-010**: System MUST configure authentication for email/password with 30-day JWT refresh tokens

**Test Infrastructure**
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide test suite for existing authentication code (AuthContext and ProtectedRoute) achieving ‚â•80% coverage
- **FR-012**: System MUST support mocking of Supabase client for unit tests without requiring live database connection
- **FR-013**: Developers MUST be able to run tests locally with `npm test` and see coverage reports with `npm test:coverage`

**Documentation & Developer Experience**
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear documentation for setting up local environment (Supabase configuration, running tests, understanding CI pipeline)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: CI pipeline MUST complete all checks within 5 minutes for typical pull requests
- **NFR-002**: Test suite MUST run in under 30 seconds for rapid feedback during TDD workflow
- **NFR-003**: Database type generation MUST be a manual step (not automated in CI) to prevent unintended schema changes
- **NFR-004**: CI pipeline MUST fail fast with immediate notification and direct links to error logs when any check fails (no auto-retry)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **CI Pipeline**: Automated workflow that validates code quality through linting, type checking, testing with coverage enforcement, and build verification. Triggered on PR and main branch pushes.

- **Supabase Project**: Backend-as-a-Service environment (staging) hosting PostgreSQL database with auth, realtime, and storage capabilities. Configured with required extensions and initial multi-tenant schema.

- **Database Schema**: Initial set of tables (organizations, users, projects, user_organizations) structured for multi-tenant support with basic Row Level Security policies for organization-level data isolation (minimal enforcement in Sprint 0, comprehensive policies in Sprint 1). Managed through migration files.

- **Test Suite**: Collection of unit and integration tests covering authentication flows (AuthContext, ProtectedRoute) with Supabase client mocking strategy. Enforces coverage thresholds.

- **TypeScript Types**: Auto-generated type definitions from Supabase schema providing compile-time safety for database queries. Stored in version control at src/types/database.types.ts.

### Assumptions & Dependencies

**Assumptions**
- Vercel project is already configured (vercel.json exists)
- Frontend codebase is already initialized with React, TypeScript, Vite, and test infrastructure (Vitest)
- Team follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) discipline per Constitution v1.0.0
- Solo developer environment (no migration conflicts or multi-dev coordination needed)
- Project lead provisions Supabase staging project and shares credentials via team .env template

**Dependencies**
- GitHub repository with branch protection enabled for main branch
- Supabase staging project (provisioned by project lead with CLI access enabled)
- Vercel account connected to GitHub repository
- Team members have local development tools: Node.js, npm, Supabase CLI

**Out of Scope (Deferred to Sprint 1)**
- Full database schema with all 13 tables (only organizations, users, projects, user_organizations for Sprint 0)
- Test data seeding (empty database in Sprint 0, seed scripts deferred to Sprint 1)
- Progress templates seeding (defer to Sprint 1)
- Comprehensive RLS policy enforcement and integration tests (basic policies only in Sprint 0)
- Component CRUD operations and business logic (defer to Sprint 1)
- Production deployment and security hardening (staging only for Sprint 0)
