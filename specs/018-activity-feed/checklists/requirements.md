# Specification Quality Checklist: Dashboard Recent Activity Feed

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All items validated successfully

**Details**:

### Content Quality
- ✅ Spec avoids implementation details (no mention of PostgreSQL views, TanStack Query, React components in requirements)
- ✅ Focused on user value: "project managers can see activities", "understand context", "real-time updates"
- ✅ Written in plain language suitable for non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec (all design decisions made during brainstorming)
- ✅ All FRs are testable: "MUST display last 10 activities", "MUST show in reverse chronological order", "MUST update within 3 seconds"
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics: "within 3 seconds", "under 100 milliseconds", "95% accuracy"
- ✅ Success criteria are tech-agnostic: describe user outcomes, not implementation
- ✅ Each user story has multiple acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases comprehensively documented (empty state, deleted users, missing data, connection failures)
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines feature boundaries
- ✅ Dependencies and Assumptions sections document context

### Feature Readiness
- ✅ FRs map directly to user stories and acceptance criteria
- ✅ User stories cover all primary flows: viewing activities, understanding context, historical data, user identification
- ✅ Success criteria align with feature goals: visibility, performance, real-time updates, historical data access
- ✅ Implementation details properly relegated to Dependencies section, not leaked into requirements

## Notes

- Specification is production-ready and can proceed directly to planning phase
- Design document already exists at `docs/plans/2025-10-28-recent-activity-feed-design.md` providing implementation guidance
- Feature leverages existing UI components and database tables, minimizing implementation risk
