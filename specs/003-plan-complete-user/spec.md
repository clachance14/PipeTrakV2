# Feature Specification: Complete User Data Storage During Signup

**Feature Branch**: `003-plan-complete-user`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Plan: Complete User Data Storage During Signup - Current Gaps: 1. public.users table never populated - Table exists but no trigger creates records 2. Terms acceptance not tracked - Checkbox validated but timestamp not stored"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a new user registers for a PipeTrak account, the system must capture and permanently store all information they provide during signup (email, full name, organization name, and terms acceptance). Currently, some user information is lost after registration, preventing the system from displaying user profiles and tracking compliance with terms of service.

Additionally, when users who registered before this fix login, they should see their complete profile information without needing to re-register.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user completes the registration form with email, password, full name, and organization name, and accepts the terms of service, **When** registration completes successfully, **Then** all provided information must be permanently stored and immediately retrievable
2. **Given** a new user has just registered, **When** they login and view their profile, **Then** their full name, email, and organization membership must be visible
3. **Given** a user who registered before this fix is deployed, **When** they login after deployment, **Then** their email and full name must be visible in their profile
4. **Given** a new user accepts the terms of service during registration, **When** an administrator audits compliance records, **Then** the timestamp of terms acceptance must be recorded and retrievable
5. **Given** multiple users register within the same time period, **When** all registrations complete, **Then** each user's data must be completely and accurately stored without data loss

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user registration partially completes (e.g., account created but organization creation fails)? System must ensure data consistency - either all data is stored or none is stored.
- How does the system handle existing users who registered before the fix? System must backfill missing profile data from authentication records without requiring re-registration.
- What happens if terms acceptance timestamp is missing for legacy users? System must distinguish between "never accepted" (error state) and "accepted before tracking was implemented" (valid legacy state).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST store user email address permanently when a user registers
- **FR-002**: System MUST store user full name permanently when a user registers
- **FR-003**: System MUST record the exact timestamp when a user accepts terms of service during registration
- **FR-004**: System MUST track which version of terms the user accepted (default: v1.0 for current system)
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically create user profile records when new accounts are created, without requiring manual intervention
- **FR-006**: System MUST backfill profile information for existing users who registered before this feature was deployed
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain referential integrity between user accounts and their profile information
- **FR-008**: System MUST make all stored user information immediately available after successful registration
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow authorized users to view their own profile information including email, full name, and terms acceptance status
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent data loss during registration - if any required information cannot be stored, the entire registration must fail cleanly

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Profile creation must complete within the same transaction as account creation (atomic operation)
- **NFR-002**: Backfill operation for existing users must complete without system downtime
- **NFR-003**: User profile data must be accessible with the same performance characteristics as other user-specific queries

### Key Entities

- **User Profile**: Represents the complete profile information for a registered user, including:
  - Email address (unique identifier for login)
  - Full name (for display and personalization)
  - Account creation timestamp
  - Last update timestamp
  - Links to the authentication account

- **Terms Acceptance Record**: Tracks when and which version of terms a user accepted, including:
  - Timestamp of acceptance
  - Version of terms accepted (for future terms updates)
  - Links to the user who accepted
