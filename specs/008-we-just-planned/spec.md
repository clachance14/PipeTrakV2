## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **construction project manager**, I want to view real-time project metrics and navigate between functional pages so that I can track component progress, manage test packages, resolve flagged issues, and oversee welder activities without seeing placeholder data.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has just logged in with access to multiple projects, **When** they land on the home page, **Then** the system automatically selects their first project and displays that project's dashboard with live metrics (overall progress, packages ready, needs review count, recent activity).

2. **Given** a user is viewing the dashboard, **When** they click on a navigation item in the sidebar (e.g., "Test Packages"), **Then** the system navigates to that page and displays real data filtered to the currently selected project.

3. **Given** a user switches to a different project using the project selector dropdown, **When** the project changes, **Then** all page data refreshes to show metrics and content for the newly selected project.

4. **Given** a user is on the Test Packages page, **When** they view the list of packages, **Then** each package card shows actual progress percentage, component count, blocker count, and target date from the database.

5. **Given** a user with appropriate permissions is on the Needs Review page, **When** they click "Resolve" on a flagged item, **Then** a dialog opens allowing them to add a resolution note and mark the item as resolved or ignored.

6. **Given** a user is on the Welders page, **When** they view the welder directory, **Then** each welder shows their name, stencil, verification status, weld count, and verification date (if applicable).

7. **Given** a user with welder management permissions, **When** they click "Verify" on an unverified welder, **Then** the system marks that welder as verified and records who verified them and when.

8. **Given** a user clicks "Add Welder", **When** they submit the form with a valid name and stencil, **Then** the system creates the welder with unverified status and validates that the stencil doesn't already exist.

9. **Given** a user is viewing any page, **When** they click the sidebar toggle button, **Then** the sidebar collapses to show only icons (or expands to show full labels), and this preference persists across page navigation.

10. **Given** a user without appropriate permissions views the sidebar, **When** the navigation renders, **Then** restricted items (e.g., Team management for non-admins) are hidden from view.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a user has no projects?**
  System displays a friendly message: "No projects available. Contact your administrator to be assigned to a project."

- **What happens when a project has no components yet?**
  Dashboard shows 0% progress, 0 components, and empty state messages on relevant pages ("No components found" with option to import).

- **What happens when needs review count is 0?**
  Needs Review page shows success message: "No items need review" with a green checkmark. Sidebar badge disappears.

- **What happens when package readiness view has no data?**
  Test Packages page shows empty state: "No test packages found" with a button to create one.

- **What happens when a welder stencil already exists?**
  Add Welder form shows validation error: "Welder stencil already exists in this project" and prevents submission.

- **What happens when a user tries to verify a welder without permission?**
  The "Verify" button is hidden from the UI. If accessed directly, the system rejects the action.

- **What happens when switching projects mid-workflow?**
  System immediately refreshes all displayed data to match the new project context. Any open modals/dialogs remain open but may show different data or close if the entity no longer applies to the new project.

- **What happens when the sidebar is collapsed on mobile?**
  On small screens, the sidebar automatically collapses to icon-only view by default. Users can still expand it temporarily via a hamburger menu button.

- **What happens when dashboard metrics fail to load?**
  System displays error state with retry button: "Failed to load metrics. [Retry]" for each affected card.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Sprint 1 Core Foundation (Feature 005) MUST be complete - provides database schema, tables, hooks, and materialized views.
- Permission system (7 roles, 6 permissions) MUST be functional for permission-gated UI.
- ProjectContext MUST correctly manage selected project state across routes.
- TanStack Query hooks MUST be available: useComponents, useTestPackages, useNeedsReview, useWelders, useAuditLog, useRefreshDashboards.

### Assumptions
- Database materialized views (mv_package_readiness, mv_drawing_progress) refresh every 60 seconds automatically or can be manually triggered.
- Users will have at least one project assigned; "no projects" is a rare edge case.
- File upload implementation for Imports page is explicitly out of scope for this feature (foundation only).
- Existing Layout component with top navigation (project selector, search, notifications, user menu) remains functional.
- Responsive design targets desktop-first with mobile optimization as secondary priority.

### Out of Scope
- Real-time presence tracking ("Active Users" dashboard card) - deferred to future feature.
- Full file upload implementation on Imports page - placeholder UI only.
- Advanced filtering options (date ranges, custom filters) - basic filters only.
- Export functionality (Excel/PDF reports) - not included.
- Dark mode theme support - not included.
- Mobile-specific app optimization - responsive web only.
