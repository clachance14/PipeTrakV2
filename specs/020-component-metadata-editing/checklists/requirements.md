# Specification Quality Checklist: Component Metadata Editing from Drawings View

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Notes**:
- Specification successfully translates the technical design document into user-focused requirements
- All 18 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (performance times, percentages, counts)
- 4 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1-P3)
- 6 edge cases identified with clear resolution paths
- No implementation details in spec (technical details remain in design document)
- Scope is well-bounded: editing metadata only (not drawing assignment, component type, or custom attributes)
- Dependencies clear: existing ComponentDetailView, database schema, RLS policies

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (design document provides complete technical foundation)
