## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a foreman**, I need to update component progress while working in the field so that project managers can track completion status in real-time. My workflow is opportunistic—I jump between drawings based on what's getting done (material deliveries, crew availability, site conditions). I need to see all drawings at a glance, expand the one I'm working on, and update milestones with minimal clicks.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: View Drawing Progress Summary
1. **Given** I am on the components page
2. **When** I view the table
3. **Then** I see a list of all drawings with:
   - Drawing number
   - Drawing title
   - Progress summary showing completed vs. total components (e.g., "15/23")
   - Average progress percentage (e.g., "65%")
   - Total component count

#### Scenario 2: Expand Drawing to See Components
1. **Given** I am viewing the drawing list
2. **When** I click on a drawing row
3. **Then** the drawing expands to reveal all components beneath it
4. **And** components are indented to show hierarchy
5. **And** I see each component's identity, type, and individual milestones

#### Scenario 3: Update Discrete Milestone (Checkbox)
1. **Given** a drawing is expanded showing components
2. **When** I click a milestone checkbox for a component
3. **Then** the checkbox toggles immediately (checked/unchecked)
4. **And** the component's progress percentage updates automatically
5. **And** the drawing's progress summary updates to reflect the change
6. **And** the milestone event is recorded with timestamp and my user ID

#### Scenario 4: Update Partial Milestone (Percentage)
1. **Given** a drawing is expanded showing a component with partial milestones
2. **When** I click on a percentage value (e.g., "75%")
3. **Then** an inline editor appears allowing me to adjust the percentage
4. **When** I set a new value (0-100%)
5. **Then** the component's progress percentage recalculates
6. **And** the drawing's progress summary updates

#### Scenario 5: Collapse Drawing
1. **Given** a drawing is expanded
2. **When** I click the drawing row again
3. **Then** the component list collapses
4. **And** I can expand a different drawing to work on next

#### Scenario 6: Navigate Between Multiple Drawings
1. **Given** I have multiple drawings expanded
2. **When** I scroll through the table
3. **Then** I can see components from multiple drawings simultaneously
4. **And** each drawing's components remain grouped beneath their parent drawing

#### Scenario 7: Search for Specific Drawing
1. **Given** I am on the components page
2. **When** I type a drawing number in the search box (e.g., "P-001")
3. **Then** the table filters to show only matching drawings
4. **And** I can expand the filtered drawing to see its components

#### Scenario 8: Filter by Progress Status
1. **Given** I want to focus on incomplete work
2. **When** I select "In Progress" from the filter dropdown
3. **Then** the table shows only drawings that are partially complete (>0% and <100%)

### Edge Cases

#### Drawing with No Components
- **What happens when** a drawing exists but has no components assigned?
  - **Expected**: Drawing row displays "0 items" and cannot be expanded (no expand icon shown)

#### Component with Different Milestone Templates
- **How does the system handle** components of different types under the same drawing (e.g., valves with 5 milestones, instruments with 3 milestones)?
  - **Expected**: Each component row shows only its template-specific milestones. Column headers adapt to show all unique milestones present in the expanded view.

#### Simultaneous Updates
- **What happens when** two users update the same component's milestone at the same time?
  - **Expected**: Last write wins. The second user sees their update reflected. Both updates are recorded in the audit trail with timestamps.

#### Offline Updates
- **How does the system handle** milestone updates when the user loses internet connection?
  - **Expected**: Update attempt fails with clear error message: "Unable to save. Check your connection." User can retry when connection is restored.

#### Large Drawings (100+ Components)
- **What happens when** a drawing contains 100+ components?
  - **Expected**: All components load when drawing is expanded. Table remains performant with smooth scrolling. No pagination within a single drawing.

#### Invalid Percentage Input
- **What happens when** a user enters an invalid percentage (e.g., 150%, -10%, "abc")?
  - **Expected**: Input validation prevents saving values outside 0-100 range. Non-numeric input is rejected with error message.

#### Drawing with All Components Complete
- **How does the system handle** a drawing where all components are 100% complete?
  - **Expected**: Drawing row shows "23/23 • 100%" with visual indicator (e.g., green highlight). Drawing can still be expanded to view completed components.

### Key Entities

#### Drawing Row
Represents a single drawing in the project with aggregated progress metrics:
- **Drawing Number**: Unique normalized identifier (e.g., "P-001")
- **Drawing Title**: Optional descriptive name (e.g., "Main Process Line")
- **Progress Summary**: Completed component count, total component count, average progress percentage
- **Component Count**: Total number of components assigned to this drawing
- **Expansion State**: Boolean indicating whether components are currently visible
- **Relationships**: Has many components

#### Component Row
Represents a single physical component within a drawing:
- **Identity Key**: Type-specific unique identifier (e.g., "VBALU-001 2\" (1)")
- **Component Type**: Category of component (valve, fitting, flange, pipe, etc.)
- **Progress Percentage**: Calculated completion percentage (0.00-100.00)
- **Current Milestones**: State of all milestones for this component's template
- **Parent Drawing**: The drawing this component belongs to
- **Relationships**: Belongs to one drawing, has one progress template, has many milestone events

#### Milestone Control
Interactive UI element for updating a single milestone:
- **Milestone Name**: Display name (e.g., "Receive", "Install")
- **Milestone Weight**: Percentage weight in overall progress calculation (e.g., 10%, 60%)
- **Milestone Type**: Discrete (boolean) or Partial (percentage)
- **Current Value**: Boolean true/false for discrete, 0-100 for partial
- **Editable**: Based on user permissions

#### Progress Summary
Aggregated metrics displayed at the drawing level:
- **Completed Count**: Number of components at 100% progress
- **Total Count**: Total number of components in the drawing
- **Average Percentage**: Mean of all component progress percentages
- **Display Format**: "15/23 • 65%" (completed/total • average%)

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this feature:
1. **Bulk milestone updates**: No checkbox selection or "mark all as complete" functionality
2. **Component creation or deletion**: Table is read-only for component inventory
3. **Drawing creation or retirement**: Managed in separate drawings management page
4. **Mobile app native views**: Mobile <768px shows simplified view, full feature requires desktop/tablet
5. **Offline sync**: Requires active internet connection for updates
6. **Custom milestone templates**: Uses existing progress templates only
7. **Component re-assignment**: Moving components between drawings not supported in this table
8. **Export/reporting**: No CSV export or printable reports from this view
