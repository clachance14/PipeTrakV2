## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user who needs to start tracking a new construction project, I want to quickly create a new project from the main navigation so that I can immediately begin adding drawings, components, and tracking progress without navigating through multiple pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am logged in and viewing any page with the navbar visible, **When** I open the project dropdown, **Then** I see all my existing projects plus an "Add New Project" option at the bottom

2. **Given** I select "Add New Project" from the dropdown, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** I am taken to a dedicated project creation page with a form

3. **Given** I am on the project creation page, **When** I enter a project name and description and submit, **Then** the new project is created, automatically selected as my active project, and I am navigated to the home page

4. **Given** I am on the project creation page, **When** I click Cancel, **Then** I am returned to the home page without creating a project

5. **Given** I am filling out the project form, **When** I attempt to submit with empty or whitespace-only fields, **Then** I see validation errors and the form does not submit

6. **Given** I have submitted a valid project form, **When** the creation succeeds, **Then** the new project appears in the dropdown and is automatically selected

7. **Given** I have no existing projects, **When** I open the project dropdown, **Then** I see "No projects yet" and the "Add New Project" option

### Edge Cases

- What happens when project creation fails due to network error?
  - User sees an error notification and remains on the form page with their data intact

- What happens if the user navigates away during form submission?
  - The creation completes in the background, but the user is not navigated or auto-selected (they manually chose to leave)

- What happens when a user creates a project with the same name as an existing project?
  - The system allows it (no unique constraint exists on project names within an organization)

- What happens if the dropdown is opened while on the project creation page?
  - The dropdown shows the currently selected project (not the "Add New Project" option)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Navigation & Discovery
- **FR-001**: System MUST display an "Add New Project" option in the project dropdown for all authenticated users
- **FR-002**: The "Add New Project" option MUST appear at the bottom of the dropdown list, after all existing projects
- **FR-003**: When user selects "Add New Project", system MUST navigate to a dedicated project creation page
- **FR-004**: The project dropdown MUST NOT change the currently selected project when navigating to the creation page

#### Project Creation Form
- **FR-005**: The creation page MUST display a form with two fields: Project Name and Project Description
- **FR-006**: Both Project Name and Project Description MUST be required fields
- **FR-007**: The form MUST validate that fields are non-empty after trimming whitespace
- **FR-008**: The form MUST display validation errors when required fields are empty or whitespace-only
- **FR-009**: The submit button MUST be disabled during form submission
- **FR-010**: The form MUST include a Cancel button that navigates back to the home page

#### Project Creation & Auto-Selection
- **FR-011**: When form is submitted with valid data, system MUST create a new project associated with the user's organization
- **FR-012**: After successful project creation, system MUST automatically select the new project as the active project
- **FR-013**: After successful project creation, system MUST navigate the user to the home page
- **FR-014**: The newly created project MUST immediately appear in the project dropdown
- **FR-015**: System MUST display the new project as selected in the dropdown after creation

#### Error Handling
- **FR-016**: If project creation fails, system MUST display an error notification to the user
- **FR-017**: If project creation fails, system MUST keep the user on the form page with their entered data intact
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle network errors gracefully and inform the user

#### Special States
- **FR-019**: When user has no existing projects, dropdown MUST display "No projects yet" text along with the "Add New Project" option
- **FR-020**: The "Add New Project" option MUST remain accessible even when no projects exist

### Key Entities

- **Project**: Represents a construction project being tracked. Attributes include name (text, required), description (text, required), organization association, and creation timestamp. A user can have multiple projects within their organization.
