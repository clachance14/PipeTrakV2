# Specification Quality Checklist: Weekly Progress Reports

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written entirely in terms of user needs and system behaviors without mentioning specific technologies (React, TypeScript, Supabase, etc.). All sections focus on WHAT the system must do, not HOW it will be implemented.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 50 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-050) are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are present. The specification makes informed assumptions where details were not provided (documented in Assumptions section).

3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) are measurable and technology-agnostic. They describe outcomes from user/business perspective (e.g., "generate report in under 30 seconds", "90% of users successfully export on first attempt") rather than implementation metrics.

4. **Edge Cases**: 8 edge cases are clearly defined with expected behaviors (zero components, 100+ rows, partial milestones, no data exports, etc.).

5. **Scope**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 14 items that are NOT included in this feature, preventing scope creep.

6. **Assumptions**: 10 assumptions are documented, including company logo storage, permissions model, project selection context, and phasing decisions.

7. **User Scenarios**: 6 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) with independent test descriptions and acceptance scenarios. P1 stories form a coherent MVP.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed from user - all informed assumptions documented
- MVP scope is clearly defined by P1 user stories (Stories 1, 2, and 6)
- Earned value methodology is fully specified in FR-010 through FR-014
