## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: What password complexity standard should be enforced? ‚Üí A: Relaxed - Min 6 chars, email verification as primary security
- Q: Should organization names be unique globally or can multiple orgs share names? ‚Üí A: Non-unique; multiple organizations can share names, identified by org_id only. GTM strategy targets individual project managers first, enterprise consolidation later.
- Q: What happens when the last owner attempts to leave/delete their account? ‚Üí A: Prompt for ownership transfer; if declined, soft-delete organization and all associated user memberships/data with recovery window.
- Q: What should happen when invitation email fails to send? ‚Üí A: Notify inviter via error notification; invitation record still created for manual sharing of link.
- Q: Expected maximum users per organization for initial launch? ‚Üí A: ~50 users per organization (medium teams; requires light pagination and basic search).

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a construction company manager**, I want to create a PipeTrak account for my organization and invite my field team (foremen, welders, QC inspectors) so that we can collaboratively track pipe components across our brownfield projects with appropriate access controls.

**First User Journey (Organization Owner):**
1. Visit PipeTrak website, click "Sign Up"
2. Enter email, password, full name, and organization name
3. Accept terms of service
4. System creates organization and assigns me as owner (billing admin)
5. Complete onboarding wizard to set up organization preferences
6. Invite team members via email with assigned roles

**Invited User Journey:**
1. Receive invitation email from organization owner
2. Click invitation link in email
3. If new user: Set password and create account
4. If existing user: Sign in to accept invitation
5. System adds me to the organization with assigned role
6. Redirect to appropriate dashboard based on role

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: First User Signup (Organization Creation)
- **Given** I am a new user visiting PipeTrak for the first time
- **When** I complete the signup form with valid email, password, full name, and organization name
- **Then** The system creates my user account, creates a new organization, and assigns me the "owner" role with billing privileges

#### Scenario 2: Owner Invites Team Member
- **Given** I am logged in as an organization owner
- **When** I navigate to team management and send an invitation to "john@example.com" with role "foreman"
- **Then** The system sends an email invitation to John with a unique acceptance link valid for 7 days

#### Scenario 3: Invitee Accepts Invitation (New User)
- **Given** John receives an invitation email and has never used PipeTrak
- **When** John clicks the invitation link and sets a password
- **Then** The system creates John's account, links him to the organization with "foreman" role, and marks invitation as accepted

#### Scenario 4: Invitee Accepts Invitation (Existing User)
- **Given** John already has a PipeTrak account in Organization A and receives invitation to Organization B
- **When** John clicks the invitation link and signs in
- **Then** The system adds Organization B to John's account with the invited role, allowing him to switch between organizations

#### Scenario 5: Role-Based Dashboard Access
- **Given** I am logged in as a "welder" in my organization
- **When** I access the dashboard
- **Then** I can only view and update pipe components assigned to me, without access to billing or team management

#### Scenario 6: Owner Manages Team Roles
- **Given** I am logged in as organization owner
- **When** I change a user's role from "foreman" to "project_manager"
- **Then** The user's permissions update immediately, granting them project creation and management capabilities

#### Scenario 7: Multiple Organization Membership
- **Given** I belong to both Organization A (as owner) and Organization B (as foreman)
- **When** I log in to PipeTrak
- **Then** I can switch between organizations and my available features change based on my role in each

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invited user's email already exists in the same organization? (System should reject duplicate invitation)
- How does system handle expired invitation links? (Show error message with option to request new invitation)
- What if organization owner tries to change their own role? (System should prevent owner from removing their own owner status)
- What happens when the last owner leaves an organization? (System prompts for ownership transfer; if declined, organization and all user memberships are soft-deleted with recovery window)
- Can a user accept multiple invitations to the same organization? (System should prevent duplicate memberships)
- What happens when an invitation is sent to an already-invited pending email? (System should allow resending/updating the invitation)
- How does system handle if owner deletes their account? (Same as last owner leaving: prompt for transfer, soft-delete org/memberships if declined)
