# Current State Assessment

## 2.1 What Exists (Documents Folder)

✅ Problem Analysis – User pain points, jobs to be done, pilot plan
✅ Business Logic – Multi-tenant architecture, entities, workflows, audit
✅ User Stories – 26 stories with acceptance criteria
✅ Rules of Credit (ROC) – Milestone weights, component types, workflows
✅ Technical Implementation Reference – Quick lookup for engineering team

## 2.2 What's Missing (This Document Provides)

❌ Technology stack selection & rationale
❌ Database schema (tables, fields, types, indexes, RLS policies)
❌ API layer design (endpoints, Edge Functions, real-time subscriptions)
❌ Frontend architecture (component hierarchy, state flow, routing)
❌ Sprint-by-sprint task breakdown
❌ Technical challenge solutions (virtualization, similarity detection, etc.)
❌ Performance optimization strategy
❌ CI/CD pipeline design
❌ Security implementation (RLS, auth flows)

## 2.3 Alignment with Spec Kit Methodology

Spec Kit Phases:
1. ✅ /constitution → Create coding standards & architecture principles (Sprint 0)
2. ✅ /specify → Complete (Business Logic + User Stories + ROC)
3. ✅ /clarify → Complete (Problem Analysis + Technical Reference)
4. 🚧 /plan → THIS DOCUMENT (technical architecture & sprint breakdown)
5. ⏳ /tasks → Sprint 0 (generate granular task list from this plan)
6. ⏳ /implement → Sprints 1-7 (execute implementation with AI assistance)

Recommendation: Use Spec Kit CLI starting Sprint 0 to manage `/tasks` and `/implement`
phases. This plan serves as input to `/plan` command.
