-- Migration 00035: Backfill missing field_welds records
-- Issue: 12 field_weld components exist but have no corresponding field_welds records
-- Cause: Bug in takeoff import workflow (Feature 009)
-- Fix: Create field_welds records for all orphaned field_weld components

-- Insert field_welds records for all field_weld components that don't have them yet
